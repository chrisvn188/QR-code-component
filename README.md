## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid (for centering elements)

### What I learned

- Planning ahead saved me a lot of time. By organizing the structure of my HTML and selecting the appropriate tags, I was able to write more semantic and efficient HTML code.
- I learned how to center elements with two lines of css Grid (you can achieve same result with 3 lines of using css Flexbox)
- Craft a descriptive "alt" attribute for the img element. The "alt" attribute serves multiple purposes, prompting browsers to display a description of the image in case of loading failure. Moreover, it significantly enhances the accessibility of images for individuals with visual impairments by providing meaningful descriptions for screen readers.
